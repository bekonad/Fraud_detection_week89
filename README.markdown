# Fraud Detection Project - 10 Academy KAIM Week 8 & 9

## Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the 10 Academy KAIM Week 8 & 9 Challenge, implementing a robust fraud detection system for e-commerce and banking transactions. The project processes three datasets (`Fraud_Data.csv`, `creditcard.csv`, `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`), conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineers features, addresses class imbalance using SMOTE, trains and evaluates three machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and provides optional SHAP analysis for interpretability. The workflow is executed via Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab (5.5 GiB memory, ~5-10 minutes runtime) and organized into task-specific branches (`task1`, `task2`, `task3`) and a main branch (`main`). Deliverables include processed datasets, trained models, evaluation metrics, visualizations, and comprehensive reports (`blog_post.pdf`, `final_report.pdf`) stored in the `analysis/` directory.

## Objectives

- Develop an accurate fraud detection system for e-commerce and banking transactions.
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
- Provide interpretable insights via SHAP analysis (optional).
- Deliver professional reports and visualizations.
- Ensure reproducibility with a branch-based Git workflow in Google Colab.

  - **Tasks**:
    - Loads `Data/raw/Fraud_Data.csv`, `Data/raw/creditcard.csv`, and `Data/raw/IpAddress_to_Country.csv`.
    - Cleans data (removes duplicates, handles missing values).
    - Maps IP addresses to countries using `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`.
    - Creates features (e.g., `time_to_purchase`).
    - Applies SMOTE for class imbalance.
    - Generates EDA visualizations (class distribution, purchase patterns, feature relationships).
  - **Outputs**:
    - Processed datasets in `Data/processed/` (e.g., `creditcard_train_processed.csv`, `fraud_train_processed.csv`).

All notebooks include `import logging` to prevent `NameError: name 'logging' is not defined`, with logs saved in `outputs/`.

## Analysis Directory

The `analysis/` directory contains the final reports generated by the project:

- **`blog_post.pdf`**:
  - A Medium-style blog post for a general audience, generated from a LaTeX source (e.g., `scripts/blog_post.tex`).
  - Describes the project’s goals, data exploration, and model training.
  - Details the three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) with performance metrics (e.g., XGBoost AUC-PR ≈ 0.89, F1-Score ≈ 0.88) and visualizations (e.g., `reports/confusion_matrices/confusion_matrix_xgboost.png`, `reports/shap/shap_summary.png`).
  - Includes embedded plots from `reports/eda/` and `reports/shap/`.

- **`final_report.pdf`**:
  - A technical report for a professional audience, generated from `scripts/report.tex`.
  - Details the methodology, including data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model training.
  - Explicitly covers the three models, their configurations, performance metrics (sourced from `reports/model_results.txt`), and confusion matrices.
  - Includes SHAP analysis for XGBoost, highlighting key features (e.g., V4, V14, V10).
  - Embeds visualizations from `reports/confusion_matrices/` and `reports/shap/`.

Both reports are compiled using `latexmk` and stored in `analysis/`, tracked with Git LFS due to their size.
